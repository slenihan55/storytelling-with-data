## Overview

In the past week, many states have started to lift their social distancing policies and repoen their economy. New York, which has been the state with the greatest number of coronaivirus cases, has been planning a date to reopen their economy. In a recent press conference, Governor Cuomo expressed that the counties in NY may open at different times due the varying rate of impact that COVOID-19 has had on NY counties. We wanted to investigate whether the counties in NY have been affected by coronavirus differently and to determine if these different rates of impact could allow certain counties to repoen their economies earlier.

To explore this question, we looked at the number of cases, number of deaths, and rate of infection in the counties in New York state. We compared these statistics to the population density of each county to determine if population density impacts the effect of coronavirus in a community as evidenced by the number of cases, the number of deaths, and the rate of infection. We used scatterplots and cholorpeths to analzye our data and produce data visualizations. 

Through our data analysis, we found that there are drastically different numbers of cases, numbers of deaths, and rates of infection from the coronavirus across the counties in New York. We also found that counties with lower population densities had lower numbers of cases and deaths and lower rates of infection than counties with larger population densities. Given the difference between counties, we believe that New York State may begin to reopen counties at different times. Rural counties with low population densities have experienced fewer cases, deaths, and rates of infection that urban counties like New York City. Thus, the Governor could consider reopening the rural counties before reopening the entire state

### Downloading the data

Our dataset can be accessed at https://github.com/jeremymanning/storytelling-with-data/raw/master/data-stories/COVID-19/NY_county_COVID_data.xlsx. This dataset contains the number of coronavirus cases, number of deaths from coronavirus, rate of infection from coronavirus, and population density from the NY counties. 

### Running the code

To run the code, you must import pandas, numpy, and plotlyexpress. A link to the collaboratory notebook is here: https://github.com/slenihan55/storytelling-with-data/blob/master/data-stories/COVID-19/sophieandannette.ipynb

## Contributing to the code

The next steps for this project would be to look at the number of cases, deaths, and rates of infections in states that have already begun reopening their economies. By comparing these statistics to the statistics in New York counties, the government could determine the best course of action for when to reopen rural counties that have not been as impacted by coronavirus as the urban counties, like New York City.
