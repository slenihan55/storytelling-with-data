## Overview

The 2020 Summer Olympics have been canceled due to the risks that travel and competition pose to competitors and spectators. This cancelation marks the first time that the Olympic Games have been canceled in nearly 80 years. Many athletes spend their whole lives training for the chance to compete in this worldwide event, and the track and field events have become a centerpiece in the Summer Olympic Games during their 124 year history. Track and field includes both short and long distance running events as well as field events such as jumping and throwing. This sport requires immense physical and mental strength and preparation, and we were curious to investigate how athletes’ performance in these events have changed since the Olympic Games began. By looking at the winning times for men and women’s sprinting events, we discovered that Olympic athletes have gotten significantly faster over time. Data show that there have also been more close finishes, with less time between the gold, silver, and bronze medalists as time has progressed. This across the board improvement can be linked to enhancements in technology, training, and nutrition. We begin to see some stabilization in the performance times around 1970. This trend can be explained by the running boom of the 1970s. During this period track and field as a whole enjoyed a boom in popularity. During that time, the U.S.-based International Track Association (ITA) organized a professional track circuit which sparked widespread popularity around the sport. The beginning of international professional running in the 1970s brought track and field to it a high level of competition, which provided all athletes in the sport with the resources to access the best techniques for improving their times. This in turn left little room to significantly improve their performances over the next several decades, causing the apparent stagnation of performance that can be seen in the data.

### Running the code

To run the code, you must import pandas, numpy, and plotlyexpress. A link to the collaboratory notebook is here: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1eYR_Q7KUIgCl99q2VqOrSrlkiUAS-RKO#scrollTo=m4FQflQ2rpg1

## Contributing to the code

Have we reached our peak? Is it possible for humans to continue to run faster and significantly improve their times? Next steps would be to look at world records in sprinting events to see when they have been broken to determine if our sprinters are still getting faster.
